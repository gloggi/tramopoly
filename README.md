## Project Setup

* Update the joker stations and their rewards and bonus questions in /supabase/seeds.sql
* Using the [open data set of the city of Zürich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/ktzh_haltestellen_des_oeffentlichen_verkehrs___ogd_), update mr_t_locations in /supabase/seed.sql with all currently available stations in the city
* Set up a free Supabase project.
* Take note of the database password you used, to set up the database structure later.
* In the Supabase administration console:
  * Under Authentication -> Providers, disable the Email provider
  * Under Authentcation -> Providers, set up keycloak authentication according to the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-keycloak).
    * You'll have to send the callback URL to Clever from ITKom so he can add it to the PBS Keycloak (id.scout.ch), and he will provide the Client ID, Secret and Realm URL in return.
  * Under Authentication -> Providers, open Phone and set up [Twilio Verify integration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/phone-login/twilio) and activate "Enable phone confirmations", but don't activate "Enable Phone provider".
    * During a typical Gloggi Tramopoly, you will need credits to send around 40 messages. For development, you might need roughly 20-40 more. So around 5-10 CHF of credits should suffice. Careful: Just having the account idle for the rest of the year will cost USD 1.15 per month. So in total, SMS costs up to 20.- per year, and coincidentally 20.- is also the minimum amount which you can add to your Twilio balance.
    * Don't forget to save.
  * Under authentication -> URL Configuration, set Site URL to your productive URL, and add http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:4173 as Redirect URLs.
  * Under SQL editor -> New query, paste the contents of all files from supabase/migrations, and then supabase/seed.sql. If that sounds like too much work, see below for how to do this step using the supabase CLI instead.
  * Under Database -> Replication -> 0 tables, activate the toggle on the `abteilungen`, `groups`, `joker_visits`, `jokers`, `message_files`, `messages`, `mr_t_changes`, `mr_t_rewards`, `profiles`, `settings`, `station_visits` and `unseen_chat_activity` tables.
  * Under Project settings -> API, find your values for the Supabase project URL and API key.
* Create a copy of the file .env, name it .env.local and fill in your Supabase project URL and API key.
  * If you set up Twilio integration with Supabase, set VITE_USE_TWILIO_PHONE_VERIFICATION in your .env.local to true, otherwise leave it empty (never `false`)
* In a terminal, run:
  * `yarn`
* To deploy:
  * `yarn build`
  * Upload the contents of the generated `dist` directory to your webserver
* After you first logged in, go in Supabase to Table Editor -> profiles and set the role on the profile which was created for you to `admin`. This allows you to manage all other users in the Tramopoly UI.

### Setting up the database structure using the supabase CLI

If you don't want to copy-paste the contents of all migrations files, you can instead use the supabase CLI to do so. Fair warning: The CLI isn't exactly easy to use. It might be easier to just paste the SQL code into the editor.

* In the Supabase administration console:
  * Take note of your project id. It should be in the URL, and should be a 20-character random string.
  * Under your Supabase organization -> Access Tokens, create an access token for setting up the initial database structure
* In a terminal, run:
  * `yarn`
  * `yarn supabase login` (enter your organization access token)
  * `yarn supabase link --project-ref <your project reference>` (replace the project id with yours, and enter your database password)
  * `yarn supabase db push`
* You still have to manually paste the contents of supabase/seed.sql into the SQL editor (or apply it using the `psql` command line client)

If you've made it this far, during development you can also create new migrations by editing the database structure in the online editor, and then running:
```bash
yarn create-migration
```

### Compile and hot-reload for development

```sh
yarn dev
```
